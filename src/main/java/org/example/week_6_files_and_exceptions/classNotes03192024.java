/*
Files and Exceptions

In general, most programs have program code, but also need to interact with
other things outside of the program. This includes:

-The user (separate topic (user experience))
    **improving human-computer interactions
    **we (as programmers have no control of what the user does)

-Files - reading and writing (hashmaps)-useful,
    **examples: when you close a program and reopen it, the settings and ways the file were left are saved
        (in Intellij the "idea" file)

-Databases, organized data stores (topic 9)
    **example: bookmarks are saved in a database
        **time and date things are bookmarked are saved

-Data stored on other computers, often accessed via API calls:
    ***used in Python
    ***also used almost any App on your phone
    ***if you make a new post, the data is sent via an API call (topic 10)

---->So as a programmer, you need to be able to think about your code
    AND other things that it interacts with:
    (examples:)
    -how to talk to a database?
    -how to make an API request?
    -etc.
