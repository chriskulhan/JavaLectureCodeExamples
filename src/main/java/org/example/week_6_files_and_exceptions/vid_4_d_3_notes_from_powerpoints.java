**Reading and Writing Considerations â€“ new lines with "\n", the newline character (slide 24):

The BufferedWriter write methods do not add a newline for you
Make sure you add a \n character at the end of your lines
Or use BufferedWriter's newLine() method after each line, for example

bufWriter.newLine();   //Writes a newline character

When you read in lines with BufferedReader, it will read a line and strip off the newline character

On a PC? You may not see your newlines properly in some text editors. If not, try using "\r\n" instead of "\n" to add newlines
\r\n are the carriage return and linefeed characters; this is how PCs mark newlines
Compare to Unix-based systems - Mac and Linux - which use only \n.
Or use the newLine method to write the correct system-specific character

**Other ways of Reading and Writing (slide 25)

BufferedReader and BufferedWriter work with sequential streams of character data
They can't jump to the middle of a stream or file
Other Java classes can handle random access in a file: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/rafs.html
And, you'll have to use different classes if you want to work with bytes directly
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/bytestreams.html

Reading and writing bytes (slide 26)

Create a Path object from a String file path
No loop, but more work to process the individual lines (see below for code:)
