reference before this week's video: https://github.com/claraj/Java2545Examples/blob/main/src/main/java/week4_list_data_structure/GuestList.java

from powerpoints: Reminder arrays: (1st slide)
int[] someNumbers = new int[10];   //10 ints

String[] names = new String[4];    //4 Strings

Fixed size, data structure
Stores items of the same type; defined when created
Can contain Objects or primitive types, but all the things in one array, must be the same type
Simple, fast, and efficient â€“ minimal and fixed storage requirements
Simple syntax to create array, store items, retrieve items; loop over an array
BUT difficult to rearrange items in an array;  can't resize the array;  add items in the middle of the array; delete an item
No built-in capability for searching an array

***powerpoint slide 2: Lists:

A resizable, ordered collection of items
Items are kept in order
Can create empty list
Can add items to the end - list gets bigger
Can add items to the start or in the middle
Can get any item from the list by index
Can remove items from the start, middle or end - list get smaller
Can remove by value, or by index
Can search for items in the list
Can find out the size of the list, if it is empty

Lists are everywhere (list of: classes, friends, emails, contacts, etc.)

Java Lists: slide 5:
Three kinds of Lists in Java:
    -ArrayList
    -LinkedList
    -Vector

Java thinks about different ways you might use a list
Some data? Lots of data?
Do you need to search for data in the list?
Will you add and remove data from the start, or end, or middle?
