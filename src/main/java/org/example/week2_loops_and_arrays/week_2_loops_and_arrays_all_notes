//Constants
    -have fixed values

//loops in Java: (how to repeat things)
   - for loops
        **for doing something a certain number of times
        1. need a loop counter (count the number of repeats
        2. Decide on what number the loop counter will start
        3. specify condition when the loop will stop
            (regularly when the counter gets to a specific value)
        4. what amount the counter changes after each iteration
        5. Doesn't have to be whole numbers or positive (could count backwards and/or use doubles or floats

   - while loops
        **repeating while something is true (or false) until something is true (or false)
        **variant: "do loop"

// arrays in Java:
    **like a list in Python
    -fixed length

// Debugger in Intellij

            //when it gets to 10, the loop will stop because 10 is NOT less than 10
