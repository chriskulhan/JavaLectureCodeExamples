//It is invaluable for fixing logic errors with your code
//If your code is crashing or giving you unexpected output/behavior,
// try running it in the debugger
//It's likely a variable has a value you don't expect; or that it's not
// following the path of execution you expect (e.g. it's taking the else
// branch when you expect it to follow the if branch)
//The debugger will help you fix many logic errors with your code

//**Setting breakpoints:
//Very useful if your code is crashing or if you have a logic error that you can't figure out
//Set a breakpoint just before the code that is causing problems
//You can set more than one breakpoint if you like
//Now, when you debug your code, the debugger will pause execution when your code gets to that line
//Very helpful for testing or trying to find and fix logic errors

//**Other resources can help if debugger doesn't:
//Internet
//Stack Overflow, http://stackoverflow.com
//Make sure you search for answers before posting a new question
//Tutors and the Academic Success Center!!
//Study groups
//Ask me! In class, come to office hours, email to set up an appointment
//Java Documentation (occasionally cryptic,
// sometimes helpful) https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/index.html

//**Prevent errors with good variable names:
//If you have variables called mile, miles, numberMiles, m, number
//Can you remember which one is which?
//If you use the wrong variable, you'll probably have a bug
