//Create a variable called secretNumber, and set the value to any number between 1 and 10
//Write a loop that asks the user to guess a number that the computer is thinking of.
// Print a success message if they guess correctly. Ask the user to try again if they get it wrong.
// The user can have as many guesses as they need
//
//Extra challenge â€“ tell the user if they need to guess higher or lower
