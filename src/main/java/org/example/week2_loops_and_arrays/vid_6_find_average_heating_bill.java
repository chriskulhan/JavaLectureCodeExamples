//A heating utility company allows customers to spread the cost of bills through the year by
// charging them an average payment every month.
//The utility company averages all of the last year's bills, and uses that to estimate
// the average payment for next year
//So, if last year's bills were as shown in the table opposite, the total is $1450;
// so the average is $120.83

//Ask the user for each month's bill for last year
//Store this data in an array
//Store January's bill in element 0, February's in element 1â€¦
//Then, add up all of the bills and figure out the average - next year's average payment
//Also, display the user's data in a table of months and bill amount, so they can check
// it for accuracy
//Tip: use another array with the names of the months to help ask for data/display data.
// Can copy/paste this:
//
//String[] months = { "January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December" };
