/*todo: write out a list of comparisons for these things:

***You should know the properties of each of these data structures: (slide18)
-Array
-Lists (ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector)
-HashMap

You'll store a lot of data in your programs – useful to know what data structures
are available and what kinds of data they are suitable for, their advantages and disadvantages

***What if your data doesn't really work in any of these?

-Research other data types (Slide 19)
    SortedMap (HashMap with sorted keys), Sets, Trees…
-Extend an existing data type and customize it
-Combine data types
    you can store arrays as values in a HashMap, for example
    Or create an List of HashMaps
    Or a HashMap of HashMaps
    Or a HashMap of arrays
    ...
-Create your own data type (by creating classes)
