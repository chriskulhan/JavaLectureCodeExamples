/* ***Designing with methods:*** (slide 11)
Use methods toâ€¦
-Eliminate repetitive code (example: .toUpperCase())
-Organize program into sub-tasks (helps to organize info and when debugging)
-A method should have one specific task it does, at a certain level of detail
-You should be able to describe the purpose of your method in 1 or 2 sentences
-A method may call other methods

***Coding with methods*** (slide 12)
-Is easier to test
-Your lab code is in methods, so a test can check the method(s) you work on
-This principle applies to other projects too
-Is easier to understand
-Several small methods are easier to understand individually; than one giant block of code
-Is easier to maintain and debug
-Can focus on one, or just a few, methods - instead of the entire program
