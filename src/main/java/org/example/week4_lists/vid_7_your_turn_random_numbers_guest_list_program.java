/*Instructions for Guest list program:  slides (51-54)

1. Create an empty list.
2. Use a while loop to ask the user for the names of guests. They will enter the names,
    one by one. Add each name to the list. When the user is done, they should press enter to
    stop adding names.

    -Your program should reject duplicate names. Don't add a name to the list if that name is
        already in the list.
3. Sort the names in alphabetical order
4. Print all the names entered
5. Ask the user if they would like to delete any names. Use a while loop so the user can delete as many
    names as needed. You can either use remove to delete by name, or delete by index. You can decide what
    the user should do to end this loop.
6. Print all the names again
7.Print the total number of guests
8.Comment your code!
9. Challenge: select a guest at random to win a prize. Print their name
10. Challenge: add validation to your program so it doesn't crash if the user enters invalid data.
    Places to add validation:
Check for valid names if removing by name; or check for valid indexes if removing names by index
End part 4's while loop if the user has removed all of the names from the guest list.
