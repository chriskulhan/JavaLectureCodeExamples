More components and events

-JCheckBox and JSlider

-Slider changed event listener
-Checkbox checked/unchecked listener
-Detecting text typed into JTextField

Order of operations:

-1. make a new "package" for all the things to live in (here movie_GUI_vid_4
0. make a new "Swing UI Designer" -> "GUI form" (found where we add all things)
    -make sure GridLayoutManager is selected
    -and bound all classes is toggles checked
1. MovieGUI.java is automatically made
2. add Main class *outside* the MovieGUI place but inside the package
    -add this:
    public class Main {
                   public static void main(String[] args) {
                       MovieGUI gui = new MovieGUI();
                   }
               }
3. Go to MovieGUI.form
    add: JLabel: movieName
        JTextField (for one line input)
            (side note JTextArea are similar, but for multiline input)
        JLabel: Rating
        JSlider beside Rating:
        JLabel for the right side of the Jslider for value : 0 stars
            **This label will get a field because it will be changed by the program
        JCheckBox: Would you watch again?
        JLabel: movieOpinion, will be updated as the other things are updated

4. add field names in the component tree area:
    JPanel: field name: mainPanel
    JTextField: field name: movieTitleTextField
    slider text field: ratingSlider
    JLabel field: sliderValueLabel
    JCheckbox field: wouldSeeAgainCheckBox
    JLabel where result will show: movieOpinionLabel

5. configure JSlider (field: ratingSlider) in component tree under Property:
    value: (initial value) set to: 0
    minimum: 0
    maximum: 5

6. make sure you don't check "custom create button" on any the components

7a. work in MovieGUI.java:
    This is already here imported from Swing:
    package org.example.week_8_GUI.movie_GUI_vid_4;

    import javax.swing.*;

    public class MovieGUI {

        private JTextField movieTitleTextField;
        private JSlider ratingSlider;
        private JCheckBox wouldSeeAgainCheckBox;
        private JPanel mainPanel;
        private JLabel sliderValueLabel;
        private JLabel movieOpinionLabel;
    }
    **add "extends JFrame"
    From this: public class MovieGUI {
    To this: public class MovieGUI extends JFrame{

7b. Set up the methods in MovieGUI.java:
    //create constructor:
    MovieGUI() {
        //set the content pane with the name of your JPanel. Here: "main panel":
        setContentPane(mainPanel);
        //figure out how big each component is and pack them into the panel
        pack();
        //make sure it can be seen:
        setVisible(true);
        //exits when the window closes:
        setDefaultCloseOperation(WindowConstants.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);

        //set up method that will deal with all the event handlers:
        //this method belongs to the MovieGUI class
        configureEventHandlers();

    }
    //set the method that will deal with all the event handlers:
    private void configureEventHandlers(){
        //todo finish this method
    }

    //write a method to update the opinion in the JLabel called "movieOpinionLabel":
    private void updateOpinion() {
        //todo finish this
    }
