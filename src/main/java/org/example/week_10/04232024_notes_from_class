**what is an API?
- An api is a way for two computers to talk to each other

**for this class, we will use a public API (instead of creating a server and website, etc.)
    Github (for example)
    parts of github talk to each other using internal APIs
    -users
    -repositories
    -github classroom creates your assignments
    -project management

    How would a business use Github (needs to talk/update a program in github)
    -example of an external API request (public API requests)

    **not all companies allow public API requests

    week 10 Q2 will write code in java programs (or python or C#, cotlin, swift, adroid app, etc.)
        that talk to github at github APIs

**working on Q1:

example in python:
import requests //include a library that helps make API requests

//the program needs to know the URL for the API request
url: 'https//week_10/q1_compliment/RandomCompliment.java'

//make a request, store the response
//this line also converts the response from JSON to python objects

compliment_response = requests.get(url).json()
//a dictionary - like a java hashmap

print(compliment_response)
//this is a JSON response:
//like python arrays and python lists
//like java hashmaps, keys, and values

//output: {'text': 'You light up a room!'}

text = compliment_response.get('text')

print(text)
//output: You light up a room!

*****java MUST have types
***python just makes a guess of the type

**cannot make a variable in Java and figure out the type later???
    NOPE!

**know what data is expected in a response from the API and store the data
**can convert JSONObject and JSONArrays, but this is awkward.

**Another way:
    class ComplimentResponse {
    String text;
    }
    ---Convert the JSON response into a Java Object
    ---Map the keys in JSON to fields in Java Objects


Thing we know:
    1. The structure of the response

    2. can make a class that maps to that structure (the keys and the response to the fields in the class)
    3. match the keys in the response to the fields in the class, when we define a class
    4. can ask a library (Unirest) to convert the JSON repsonse to a java object
    5. Now we have objects we can use in our program
