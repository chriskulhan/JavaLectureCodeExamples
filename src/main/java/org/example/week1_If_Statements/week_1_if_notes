-stringInput-
String name = stringInput("What is your name?");

-intInput -
**asks question and also does some validation. Will ask follow-up questions without crashing:
int candyBars = intInput("How many candy bars?");

-positiveIntInput -
**checks if input is positive:
int people = positiveIntInput("How many people?");

-doubleInput -
**returns positive double values
double price = doubleInput("What is the price of the item?");

-positiveDoubleInput-
**returns positive double values
double length = positiveDoubleInput("How long is the string?");

-yesNoInput-
** y or n, or yes or no (including upper and lowercase):
boolean ok = yesNoInput("OK to continue?");

-Question is optional, so could just write:
String data = stringInput()
instead of:
System.out.println("What is your name?");

notes from video 5:
string library methods: equal and ignore case:

**check to see if strings are the same (but not the exact thing):

        if (college.equals("MCTC")) {
            //see vid_5_compare_strings for example

        **ignore case: (can be upper or lower case)
      if (college.equalsIgnoreCase("MCTC"))

-&&- AND

//check to see if both conditions are true at the same time: USE &&
        if (temp > 70 && rain == 0) {
            System.out.println("Warm and no rain - a nice day! ");

-|| (pipe character)- OR

//check to see if one condition or another condition or both are true: USE ||
        if (temp < 20 || windchill < -30) {
            System.out.println("Brrr, stay inside today!");

-Boolean-

use in comparisons

boolean easyMode = true;

if (easyMode == true) {
	System.out.println("Here's a hint...");
}

//simpler:

if (easyMode) {
	System.out.println("Here's a hint... ");
}

**library function that returns a true or false value:**

Can use the values true and false in comparisons

String sentence = "I'm a sentence";

//see if this sentence ends with a period:

if (sentence.endsWith(".") == false) {
	System.out.println("A sentence should end with a . ");
}

// Alternatively, use !
// The ! reverses the truth of an expression

//if not sentence ends with a period: (not is the !)

if (! sentence.endsWith(".")) {
	System.out.println("A sentence should end with a . ");
