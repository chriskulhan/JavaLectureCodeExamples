-stringInput-
String name = stringInput("What is your name?");

-intInput -
**asks question and also does some validation. Will ask follow-up questions without crashing:
int candyBars = intInput("How many candy bars?");

-positiveIntInput -
**checks if input is positive:
int people = positiveIntInput("How many people?");

-doubleInput -
**returns positive double values
double price = doubleInput("What is the price of the item?");

-positiveDoubleInput-
**returns positive double values
double length = positiveDoubleInput("How long is the string?");

-yesNoInput-
** y or n, or yes or no (including upper and lowercase):
boolean ok = yesNoInput("OK to continue?");

-Question is optional, so could just write:
String data = stringInput()
instead of:
System.out.println("What is your name?");

string library methods: equal and ignore case:

**check to see if strings are the same (but not the exact thing):

        if (college.equals("MCTC")) {
            //see vid_5_compare_strings for example

        **ignore case: (can be upper or lower case)
      if (college.equalsIgnoreCase("MCTC"))
